# Pong Game
This is a simple Pong game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a player-controlled paddle on the left side and an AI-controlled opponent paddle on the right side. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

 # Features
1. Player-controlled Paddle (Left): The player can move the paddle up and down using the arrow keys.
2. AI-controlled Paddle (Right): The AI controls the opponent's paddle, moving it up and down to follow the ball.
3. Sound Effects: Enjoy sound effects when the ball hits a paddle or when a score is made.
4. Scoreboard: The score is displayed at the center of the screen.
5. Ball Physics: The ball bounces off walls and paddles, and its speed changes over time.
 # Controls
1. Up Arrow (↑): Move the left paddle (Orpheus) up.
2. Down Arrow (↓): Move the left paddle (Orpheus) down.
 # Game Logic
1. The ball moves in a random direction at the start of each round.
2. When the ball touches the left or right wall, the opposing player scores a point.
3. After each point, the ball resets, and a countdown from 3 to 1 is displayed before the next round begins.
